A SLURM plugin to build a cluster on-the-fly, using the 
submit-host as a head node that exports private mounts.

usage:
First, decide which directories on the submit-host should be exported to other
nodes. /home, /opt, and /usr are automatically exported. Any other directories
to be exported are done so with the environment variable CCMOUNTS. For example, 
to have slave nodes NFS mount '/data/mydir' and '/raid0', set CCMOUNTS in either 
the submission shell, or the job script:

$ export CCMOUNTS="/data/mydir,/raid0"

where multiple directories are separated by either commas or spaces. Directories 
which may not be exported are /, /dev, /lib, /lib64, /proc, /tmp, and /var.

The plugin will automatically export the file systems to the nodes allocated
to your job, create necessary mount points, and un-export/clean-up when finished, 
leaving the slave nodes in their original state.

Note that the exported directories are private to the job and its children, 
totally transparent to the operating system and other jobs in the slave node's 
process space.
